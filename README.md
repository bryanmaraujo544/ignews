> A blog where the users need to pay for monthly subscription to read the articles. 

## üíª How it works

There are articles in the blog, but to access the full content the user needs to purchase for one subscription using its debit/credit card. The users who don't 
have one subscription can see only the preview of post.

## :hammer: How it was made

  The main technologies used it was Next.js with Typescript, responsible to create the interfaces of the applications, and it handled either the back-end routes in 
the front-end. This routes in front-end it was responsible to connect the application with the FaunaDB, Prismic CMS, Stripe and Next-auth.
  The database is saving the data of users and the subscriptions purchased. To handle the payments transactions it was used Stripe. Next Auth it was responsible to control the access of users in post.
